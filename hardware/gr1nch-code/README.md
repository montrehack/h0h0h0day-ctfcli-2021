# Gr1nch's Code

> Author: alexandre-lavoie

The Gr1nch uses a machine (`circuit.png`) to decode messages.

This is a very tedious process of inputting the message chracters by characters on the dipswitches and decoding the LEDs.

Santa's elves were able to take the Gr1nch's machine and a top secret message (`message.txt`) in a recovery mission.

The elves attached an Arduino running a script (`arduino.ino`) to bypass the dipswitches.

After hours of hacking, they were not able to find an algorithm to decode the message.

Can you help the elves break the code and reveil Gr1nch's evil plan?
