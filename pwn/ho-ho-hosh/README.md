# h0h0h0day - Ho Ho HoSH
This challenge has two flags. The first one is obtained when you login and the second is obtained when you read the file `flag.txt` from the GNLS prompt.

# Lore
Last year, Santa tried to use a computer system to store his Good and Naughty list, but Dio the Mischievious Elf pulled a prank on him and all of the data was gone. To repent for the wrong he did last year, Dio had to find a new system that would be more secure. Did he succeed?

# Part 1
Login to the challenge machine via SSH using the following credentials:
```
User: hohohosh
Pass: montrehack
Host: [ip/hostname goes here]
Port: 47422
```

Explore the shell. You need to find a way to login. Have fun and remember that bruteforce is not necessary!

# Part 2
Login to the challenge machine via SSH using the following credentials:
```
User: hohohosh
Pass: montrehack
Host: [ip/hostname goes here]
Port: 47422
```

Explore the privileged shell. You are looking for the source code of the program. Try out different commands with and without arguments. The "help" command might be useful, but it also might not tell the whole truth.
